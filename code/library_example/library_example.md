In the older days, people used to perform Machine Learning tasks by manually coding all the algorithms and mathematical and statistical formula. This made the process time consuming, tedious and inefficient. But in the modern days, it is become very much easy and efficient compared to the olden days by various python libraries, frameworks, and modules. Today, Python is one of the most popular programming languages for this task and it has replaced many languages in the industry, one of the reason is its vast collection of libraries. Python libraries that used in Machine Learning are:

Library Name | Use & Details
------------ | -------------
Numpy | Python library for large multi-dimensional array and matrix processing. particularly useful for linear algebra, Fourier transform, and random number capabilities
Scipy | Contains different modules for optimization, linear algebra, integration and statistics. useful for image manipulation
